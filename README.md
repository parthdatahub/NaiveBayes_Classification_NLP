# Movie Review Classifier using Naive Bayes (NLP)

This repository contains a movie review classifier built using Naive Bayes, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm for text classification tasks. The classifier analyzes movie reviews and predicts whether they are positive or negative sentiments.

## Movie Review Classifier Interview Questions

1. **What is Naive Bayes?**
   Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is commonly used for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and document categorization.

2. **How does Naive Bayes work for text classification?**
   Naive Bayes calculates the probability of a given document belonging to a particular class (e.g., positive or negative sentiment) based on the occurrence of words in the document. It assumes that the presence of each word is independent of the presence of other words, which is a "naive" assumption but often works well in practice.

3. **What is the Bag-of-Words representation?**
   Bag-of-Words is a common technique used for text classification. It represents a document as a vector of word frequencies, ignoring the word order but considering their occurrence. Each element in the vector represents the frequency of a specific word in the document.

4. **How do you preprocess the movie review text data?**
   Preprocessing steps include converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, tokenization (splitting text into words), removing stop words (common words like "the," "and," etc.), and stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).

5. **What is the training process for the Naive Bayes Classifier?**
   During training, the classifier learns the probabilities of words given each class (positive or negative sentiment) and the prior probabilities of each class. These probabilities are later used to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

6. **What are the performance metrics used to evaluate the Movie Review Classifier?**
   Common performance metrics for text classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.

7. **How to improve the performance of the Movie Review Classifier?**
   Performance can be improved by using more advanced text representation techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), using more sophisticated models, or tuning hyperparameters.

8. **What are some potential challenges with using Naive Bayes for text classification?**
   Naive Bayes assumes independence between words, which may not always hold true. Rare words or out-of-vocabulary words can also pose challenges for the classifier.

9. **What are some potential applications of the Movie Review Classifier?**
   The Movie Review Classifier can be used for sentiment analysis in movie reviews, allowing businesses to gain insights into audience reactions and preferences.

Important Parameters in Naive Bayes Classifier
alpha: This is a smoothing parameter that prevents zero probabilities for unseen features. It is commonly used in Multinomial Naive Bayes, and its default value is 1.0. You can tune this hyperparameter to improve model performance.
Movie Review Classifier Interview Questions and Answers
What is Naive Bayes, and how does it work for text classification?
(Answer from the previous section)

How do you handle data preprocessing for movie review text data?
Preprocessing steps include converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.

What is the Bag-of-Words representation, and why is it commonly used in text classification?
Bag-of-Words is a technique that represents text data as a vector of word frequencies. It is widely used in text classification because it simplifies the text into a numerical format that machine learning models can handle.

How do you evaluate the performance of the Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis?
The performance can be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix, which shows the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative classifications.

What are some potential challenges with using Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis?
Naive Bayes assumes independence between words, which may not hold true in some cases. Additionally, the presence of rare words or out-of-vocabulary words can pose challenges for the classifier.

What techniques can be used to improve the performance of the Movie Review Classifier?
Techniques to improve performance include using more advanced text representations like TF-IDF, tuning the alpha hyperparameter, and exploring more sophisticated models.
